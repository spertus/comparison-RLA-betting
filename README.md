# comparison-RLA-betting

Contains code to construct efficient *bets* for betting supermartingales used to measure risk in ballot-level comparison audits, and evaluates alternative betting strategies against each other using simulations. Code is as follows:

- `comparison_audit_simulations.R` runs simulations of alternate strategies and saves results. 

- `comparison_audit_figures.R` generates the figures in the paper, some of which use the saved data from `comparison_audit_simulations.R`
